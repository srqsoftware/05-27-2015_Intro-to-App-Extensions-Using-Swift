# Introduction to Application Extensions Using Swift by Bill Zink

Meeting agenda: http://srqsoftware.github.io/05-27-2015_Intro-to-App-Extensions-Using-Swift/

# Abstract

Will went out to Apple and attended a WatchKit lab. There, he learned a number of valuable design philosophies that are worth passing-on. He will create a simple application extension and a WatchKit app (which is an app extension), and do it all using Swift, Apple's new programming language.  This talk will not only serve as a way to learn application extension development but as an introduction to the Swift programming language.
