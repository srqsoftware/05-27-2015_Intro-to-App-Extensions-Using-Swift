# Introduction to Application Extensions Using Swift

# Abstract

Will went out to Apple and attended a WatchKit lab. There, he learned a number of valuable design philosophies that are worth passing-on. He will create a simple application extension and a WatchKit app (which is an app extension), and do it all using Swift, Apple's new programming language.  This talk will not only serve as a way to learn application extension development but as an introduction to the Swift programming language.
